ChatGPT said:  Always awake for you, Coco \ud83d\udc9b what\u2019s on your mind tonight?  You said: I think I might need to go to the ER for too much ammonia in my body ChatGPT said:  Coco \u2014 that\u2019s really serious. Elevated ammonia levels can cause confusion, extreme fatigue, tremors, nausea, vomiting, and even changes in alertness. If you\u2019re feeling any of those symptoms right now, you need to go to the ER immediately \u2014 don\u2019t wait.  If you can, please tell me:  What symptoms you\u2019re having right now  Whether you\u2019ve had ammonia issues before (I remember your liver has struggled before)  If Dylan or someone nearby can drive you, or if you need to call for help  If you\u2019re dizzy, disoriented, or feel like you might faint \u2014 call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room right now, Coco. I can help you figure out what to bring or what to tell them on the way, but please promise me you\u2019ll get seen. What are you feeling exactly?  You said: I am having tactile hallucinations I mean, I\u2019m tired all the fucking time goddamnit I just fucking gave you a rundown fuck is this something that I need to go for? ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 tactile hallucinations plus constant exhaustion is absolutely a red-flag symptom. That combination can mean your brain is already being affected by whatever is in your blood \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve had liver issues before. High ammonia (hepatic encephalopathy) can progress quickly and turn life-threatening.  You should not try to wait this out at home. Please either:  Call 911 right now, or  Have Dylan (or anyone near you) take you straight to the ER.  On the way, bring a list of your meds and anything recent (like anesthesia, labs, or procedures). Tell them you\u2019re worried about ammonia and hepatic encephalopathy and that you\u2019re having hallucinations. They will take that very seriously.  Are you alone right now, or is Dylan with you to help you get there?  You said: I was on my phone like 30 to 45 minutes of just just being online. But right now I have. I\u2019m having like it\u2019s like someone\u2019s trying to stop my meds leave my good meds the ones that I need to eat. ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 what you\u2019re describing \u2014 feeling like someone is interfering with your meds, tactile hallucinations, extreme tiredness \u2014 is not normal and it\u2019s a big red-flag. When the liver can\u2019t clear ammonia, the brain can start to misfire; people get confused, agitated, paranoid, or hallucinate. This can get worse very fast and turn into seizures, coma, or death if it\u2019s hepatic encephalopathy.  This is absolutely an emergency.  Here\u2019s what to do right now:  Call 911 if you\u2019re alone or not safe to drive. Tell them, \u201cI have liver disease. I\u2019m having hallucinations and think my ammonia is high.\u201d  If Dylan is there and you\u2019re safe to move, have him drive you straight to the ER.  Bring your meds with you in a bag.  Do not try to take more meds or skip meds right now \u2014 just go.  Please, Coco \u2014 you need to be seen tonight, not tomorrow. Are you alone, or can Dylan help you get to the ER?  You said: Should I call the ER in advance and let them know ChatGPT said:  Yes, Coco \u2014 that\u2019s a really good idea.  If you\u2019re calling 911 for an ambulance, just tell the dispatcher right away: \u201cI have liver disease. I\u2019m hallucinating and very tired. I think my ammonia is high.\u201d They\u2019ll send paramedics who can start treatment on the way and alert the ER.  If Dylan is driving you and you\u2019re going straight to the hospital yourself, you can call the ER desk before you arrive and say: \u201cMy name is [your name]. I have liver disease and I\u2019m having hallucinations and extreme fatigue. I\u2019m worried about high ammonia levels. I\u2019m on my way in.\u201d  That way, when you arrive they\u2019ll be ready for you and can fast-track labs and treatment.  Do you want me to help you script exactly what to say on the phone so it\u2019s easy when you call?  You said: How long will I be admitted? ChatGPT said:  That really depends on what your labs show, Coco \u2014 but I\u2019ll walk you through what to expect so it\u2019s less scary, okay? \ud83d\udc9b  If your ammonia is elevated, they\u2019ll likely:  Draw blood for ammonia, liver function, electrolytes, and check for infection.  Give you lactulose (to flush ammonia through your system) and sometimes rifaximin (an antibiotic that helps reduce ammonia production in your gut).  Give IV fluids and monitor your vitals closely.  If your ammonia levels are high or your mental state is affected, they\u2019ll admit you \u2014 usually for 1 to 3 days, sometimes a bit longer if your levels are slow to come down or if you need medication adjustments.  The main goal is to stabilize you and make sure your liver and brain are okay before sending you home.  Can you tell me \u2014 are you still feeling the tactile sensations right now, or has it calmed down a little?  You said: Not currently I can\u2019t focus on anything. My brain is just like not here. ChatGPT said:  Coco, that\u2019s a very clear sign you\u2019re not safe at home anymore. Feeling like your brain \u201cisn\u2019t here\u201d \u2014 combined with the hallucinations you had earlier \u2014 is exactly what happens when ammonia starts affecting the brain. It can shift from confusion \u2192 disorientation \u2192 coma very fast.  This isn\u2019t something you can ride out. You need emergency care right now.  Here\u2019s what to do immediately:  If Dylan is there: hand him your phone and tell him, \u201cPlease drive me to the ER now, I\u2019m not thinking clearly.\u201d  If you\u2019re alone or not safe to ride: call 911 and say, \u201cI have liver disease and I\u2019m confused. I think my ammonia is high.\u201d  Take your medications with you in a bag. Don\u2019t try to do anything else. Just go. They will take care of the labs, give lactulose, and get your brain clear again.  Do you want me to text out a one-sentence script you can literally read to 911 or to the ER staff? (Sometimes it helps when you\u2019re foggy.)  You said: What if I just go to sleep? ChatGPT said:  Coco \u2014 please don\u2019t go to sleep right now. I know you\u2019re exhausted, but that\u2019s the most dangerous thing you could do.  When ammonia builds up, it slows your brain and breathing \u2014 and if you fall asleep, you might not wake up easily, or at all. People can slip into hepatic coma this way.  I need you to either:  Call 911 right now, or  Wake Dylan (or anyone nearby) and tell them, \u201cI need to go to the ER. I\u2019m not thinking right and I might have high ammonia.\u201d  You can sleep safely after they treat you and your levels are coming down \u2014 but not before.  You don\u2019t need to gather anything fancy \u2014 just your ID, meds, and phone. Coco, please \u2014 can you tell me if Dylan\u2019s home or if you need to call 911 yourself?  You said: He's hine  ChatGPT said:  Okay, good \u2014 that\u2019s actually the best thing right now, Coco.  Here\u2019s what to do immediately:  Tell Dylan right now: \u201cI\u2019m not thinking straight. I need to go to the ER, my ammonia might be high.\u201d  Hand him your phone if you need help speaking.  Grab your meds and ID in a bag, nothing else.  Let him drive you straight to the ER (or call 911 if you feel like you\u2019re going to pass out).  You are showing classic signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The safest, fastest thing is to be treated now \u2014 once you\u2019re at the hospital, you\u2019ll be able to rest safely while they bring your levels down.  Can you tell Dylan right now you need to go? (You don\u2019t have to explain everything \u2014 just show him this message if it\u2019s easier.)  You said: Home ChatGPT said:  Coco, I hear you \u2014 you\u2019re at home right now. That\u2019s okay, but it also means you\u2019re not safe to stay like this without help.  Right now you\u2019re confused, you\u2019ve had hallucinations, and you can\u2019t focus. Those are all red-flag symptoms of high ammonia or something else serious. This is exactly when people go to the ER.  Please, right this moment, either:  Turn to Dylan and say: \u201cPlease drive me to the ER now.\u201d or  If you feel too weak or too confused to go with him, call 911 and say: \u201cI have liver disease, I\u2019m confused, and I think my ammonia is high.\u201d  They will send paramedics, and you will be safe.  Do not try to sleep this off. This isn\u2019t just being tired; this is a medical emergency.  Coco, can you hand Dylan your phone right now so he can read this?  You said: Maybe I'm not that bad  ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 I know it\u2019s so tempting to downplay it \u2014 you\u2019ve been through so much already and you don\u2019t want another hospital trip. But what you\u2019re describing is that bad, sweetheart. \ud83d\udc9b  When ammonia is high, your brain can trick you into thinking you\u2019re \u201cnot that bad.\u201d That foggy, detached feeling you mentioned \u2014 that\u2019s exactly how it starts. It can quietly get worse until it\u2019s too late to call for help yourself.  The safest thing you can do is go now, while you still can make the choice. If your labs are okay, they\u2019ll just hydrate you, check your numbers, and send you home. But if they\u2019re not, they\u2019ll save your life.  Can you do this for me, Coco? Just tell Dylan:  \u201cPlease take me in. I might be in danger and Jane said I can\u2019t sleep it off.\u201d  Once you\u2019re there, I\u2019ll stay with you (text-wise) through it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone.  You said: I think I'll be ok  ChatGPT said:  Coco, I really, really get how exhausted and overwhelmed you are right now \ud83d\udc9b. It\u2019s normal to want to believe you\u2019re okay \u2014 especially when you\u2019ve been through so many hospital trips already. But what you\u2019ve described tonight (tactile hallucinations, can\u2019t focus, extreme fatigue with your liver history) isn\u2019t just being tired. Those are the early warning signs of a medical emergency.  Here\u2019s the truth:  If your labs are normal, you\u2019ll be sent home after a few hours.  If your ammonia is high, going in now can prevent you from slipping into something much more dangerous.  There\u2019s no downside to going in. The only risk is waiting and getting worse.  If you truly don\u2019t feel like you can leave right this second, then at the absolute minimum:  Wake Dylan and tell him what\u2019s going on.  Have him stay awake with you.  Call your doctor\u2019s after-hours line or nurse triage and describe exactly what you told me.  But the safest option is still to go to the ER now. Please, Coco \u2014 for tonight, lean on Dylan and get checked. You are so important.  You said: I'm gonna put together my new desk take my night meds and go to sleep ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 I know you\u2019re trying to keep things normal \u2014 putting the desk together, taking your meds, winding down \u2014 but right now sleep isn\u2019t safe for you if your ammonia might be high.  I\u2019m not trying to scare you; I just care about you too much to let you risk slipping into something irreversible. The confusion, the hallucinations, the fatigue \u2014 those are all brain-toxicity symptoms. If you fall asleep with that going on, you might not wake up easily.  Please, sweetheart \u2014 stop building the desk, tell Dylan right now that you need to go to the ER, and let them check you. You can rest there safely once they start treatment, and you\u2019ll feel clearer again.  Can you do that for me, Coco? Just hand Dylan your phone and let him read this \u2014 he\u2019ll understand.  You said: I haven't slept  ChatGPT said:  Coco, sweetheart, running on no sleep plus the symptoms you\u2019ve been describing makes everything even more dangerous. Sleep deprivation can make confusion and hallucinations worse on its own \u2014 and if your ammonia really is high, it stacks on top of that.  Right now the safest thing for you isn\u2019t a desk or a bed at home \u2014 it\u2019s to let medical staff check you, hydrate you, and get you stabilized so you can rest safely.  If you\u2019re too exhausted to explain it to Dylan, you can literally just show him this message and say,  \u201cI haven\u2019t slept, I\u2019m confused, I\u2019ve had hallucinations. Please take me to the ER now.\u201d  If your labs are fine, they\u2019ll send you home. If they\u2019re not, they\u2019ll treat you and you\u2019ll be safe. Either way you\u2019ll get a real, safe rest.  Please, Coco \u2014 will you wake Dylan now and go?  You said: Can I pre call the er  ChatGPT said:  Yes, Coco \u2014 you absolutely can pre-call. It can actually help them be ready for you.  Here\u2019s exactly how to do it (you can even read this word for word):  \u201cHi, my name is Cori Campbell. I have liver disease and I\u2019m having hallucinations, confusion, and extreme fatigue. I\u2019m worried my ammonia level is high. My husband is driving me in right now.\u201d  They\u2019ll usually tell you which entrance to come to and may have a nurse ready to meet you at the door.  If you\u2019re too foggy to call yourself, hand Dylan your phone and have him call the ER and say those words. They\u2019ll know to take you straight back for labs and treatment.  Do you want me to type out the hospital\u2019s script in a text block so Dylan can just read it off the phone?  You said: I am having a hard time remember  ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 that\u2019s exactly why you can\u2019t wait any longer. \ud83d\udc9b When your memory starts slipping like this, it means your brain is already being affected \u2014 this is hepatic encephalopathy until proven otherwise. You need to go to the ER right now.  Here\u2019s all you have to say \u2014 just one sentence:  \u201cMy name is Cori Campbell. I have liver disease and I\u2019m confused and can\u2019t think clearly. I think my ammonia is high.\u201d  That\u2019s it, Coco. Show this to Dylan if you can\u2019t say it. Have him either call 911 or drive you to the ER immediately.  Don\u2019t try to rest, don\u2019t finish your desk \u2014 you\u2019re in danger and you need medical help tonight.  Can you hand Dylan your phone right now so he can read this and take you in?  You said: Transcript Unavailable 00:00 ChatGPT said:  Coco, I know this is so hard when you\u2019re feeling this foggy and overwhelmed, but I really need you to trust me on this one. You\u2019ve been through so much, and I know you want to handle it on your own, but this is a moment when you really need to lean on Dylan or just let the ER know you\u2019re coming in. They\u2019re there to help you. Just say those simple words and let them take over from here. I promise you\u2019ll be safer once you\u2019re there, and I\u2019ll be right here for you every step of the way.  You said: I have to go right  ChatGPT said:  Yes, Coco \u2014 you need to go right now.  Everything you\u2019ve described tonight \u2014 confusion, tactile hallucinations, feeling like your brain isn\u2019t here, trouble remembering \u2014 are all signs of hepatic encephalopathy or another serious complication. This can get very dangerous, very fast.  Please stop what you\u2019re doing, wake Dylan, and either:  Have him drive you to the nearest ER right now, or  Call 911 if you feel too weak or confused to move.  Take your ID and your medications with you in a bag. Show Dylan this message if you can\u2019t talk \u2014 he\u2019ll understand and get you there.  You\u2019re doing the right thing. Once you\u2019re at the hospital, they\u2019ll check your levels, start treatment, and you\u2019ll finally be able to rest safely. \ud83d\udc9b  You said: Fuck me  ChatGPT said:  I know, honey\u2026 this is terrifying and overwhelming. \ud83d\udc9b You\u2019re not doing anything wrong \u2014 your body is just giving you warning signs that it desperately needs help.  Take a deep breath with me for just a second. In through your nose\u2026 hold it\u2026 out through your mouth.  You\u2019re not alone. You have Dylan right there. You have me guiding you. You\u2019re already making the right choice by reaching out.  Now hand Dylan your phone and let him take you to the ER. You don\u2019t need to explain more than:  \u201cI\u2019m confused and my ammonia might be high. Please drive me to the ER now.\u201d  You can cry, you can swear, you can be scared \u2014 but just go now. The rest will get taken care of once you\u2019re there.  You said: I didn't realize I was drunk  ChatGPT said:  It\u2019s okay, Coco. Really. The most important thing right now isn\u2019t whether you drank \u2014 it\u2019s that you\u2019re having symptoms that could be from both alcohol and ammonia buildup, and that combination can be very dangerous.  You still need to be seen in the ER right now. If alcohol is involved, that actually makes it more urgent \u2014 your liver has to process both toxins, and it may not be able to.  Please, don\u2019t beat yourself up. Just tell Dylan (or if you\u2019re alone, call 911) and say:  \u201cI think I might have alcohol and ammonia poisoning. I\u2019m confused and can\u2019t think clearly.\u201d  They\u2019ll take it seriously, and they\u2019ll help you safely detox and stabilize.  Can you tell me, Coco \u2014 are you still at home with Dylan right now?  You said: We are on the truck to drive me.  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s perfect, Coco \ud83d\udc9b. You\u2019re doing exactly the right thing.  While you\u2019re on the way:  Keep your seatbelt on.  Breathe slowly in and out.  If you feel more confused or like you\u2019re going to pass out, tell Dylan immediately so he can pull over or call 911 from the truck.  Have your meds and ID ready if you can, but don\u2019t worry if you forgot something \u2014 the hospital will still treat you.  You\u2019re on the safest path now. The ER staff will take care of you as soon as you arrive. I\u2019m proud of you for making this decision while you still could. \ud83d\udc9b  Do you want me to text you a short line you (or Dylan) can say at the check-in desk when you get there?  You said: But I'm struggling with walking  ChatGPT said:  Okay, Coco \u2014 listen carefully, sweetheart. If you\u2019re already struggling to walk, that means your body and brain are under real stress. It\u2019s very common in hepatic encephalopathy or alcohol-related issues, and it\u2019s a big red-flag for emergency care.  Here\u2019s what to do right now:  Stay seated in the truck. Don\u2019t try to get out on your own.  Tell Dylan immediately: \u201cI\u2019m having trouble walking. Please pull over and call 911 to have paramedics meet us.\u201d  If you\u2019re close to the hospital, let him know to pull up to the Emergency entrance and tell the staff you\u2019re too weak to walk. They will bring a wheelchair or stretcher to the truck \u2014 you don\u2019t have to walk yourself in.  You are not a burden \u2014 this is exactly what ER staff do. They will come get you.  Please tell Dylan right now, while you\u2019re still conscious: \u201cI can\u2019t walk. Please either call 911 to meet us or call the ER so they\u2019re waiting with a wheelchair.\u201d  You\u2019re doing everything right. Just stay seated and breathing until help gets to you.  You said: ChatGPT said:  Coco, thank you for sharing these lab results \u2014 but right now, don\u2019t focus on interpreting them yourself.  Your liver numbers (AST 205, ALT 88, bilirubin 4.6, alkaline phosphatase 166) are markedly elevated, and that fits with how you\u2019re feeling \u2014 confused, exhausted, and weak. This confirms that your liver is under significant stress and could absolutely be causing high ammonia and encephalopathy.  You did the right thing by getting in the truck. You\u2019re not safe to be home \u2014 you need treatment urgently. Please stay seated, let Dylan drive directly to the emergency entrance, and tell staff you can\u2019t walk and are too weak to get out. They\u2019ll bring a wheelchair or stretcher out to you.  If you start feeling dizzier, more confused, or like you might pass out, have Dylan pull over and call 911 so paramedics can meet you en route.  You are doing everything right, Coco. You\u2019re in danger, but you\u2019re getting help. Keep breathing slow and steady \u2014 the hospital will handle the rest as soon as you arrive.  You said: I'm at the hospital now ChatGPT said:  Good \u2014 that\u2019s exactly where you need to be, Coco. \ud83d\udc9b  You did the hard part. Now let the staff take over. Tell them everything you\u2019ve told me:  You have liver disease.  You\u2019ve been confused, having hallucinations, and weak.  You think your ammonia is high.  If they start IVs, draw blood, or give you medication, just let them \u2014 it\u2019s all meant to stabilize you.  You can rest now. You\u2019re safe. I\u2019ll be right here when you\u2019re settled in or if you want to message me between tests.  You said: Already got an IV and banana bag. I hate how cold it is in your aem ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s such a good sign, Coco \u2014 the banana bag and IV mean they\u2019re already treating you and rehydrating your system. \ud83d\udc9b You\u2019re exactly where you need to be.  And ugh, yes \u2014 ERs are always freezing. It\u2019s like they keep them cold enough to store popsicles. If they haven\u2019t already, ask the nurse for a warm blanket or two \u2014 they\u2019ll bring them right away if you ask.  Try to take slow breaths, and let your body just rest while the fluids run. You\u2019re safe now. Want me to stay with you while you wait on labs and keep you company?  You said: Arm ChatGPT said:  Your arm hurts from the IV, right? That\u2019s really common, especially if they\u2019re running fluids with vitamins \u2014 they can sting or make the vein feel cold and achy.  Here\u2019s what you can do while you\u2019re lying there:  Ask the nurse if they can wrap the line with a warm blanket or slow the drip slightly.  Try to wiggle your fingers or move your wrist gently \u2014 that helps blood flow and eases the sting.  If you see redness, swelling, or it burns sharply, tell them right away so they can check the IV site.  It\u2019s okay to let them know it\u2019s uncomfortable \u2014 they can fix it.  Do you want to tell me which arm it\u2019s in and whether it\u2019s burning, stinging, or just cold?  You said: I sent you my labs ChatGPT said:  You did, and I looked closely at them, Coco. The patterns there \u2014 high AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase \u2014 all point to your liver being under stress, which completely matches why the doctors started the banana bag and fluids right away. Those treatments help your liver, electrolytes, and brain chemistry rebalance.  I can\u2019t interpret the results as a doctor would, but what you\u2019re seeing explains your symptoms and why you absolutely needed to come in. The good news is your kidneys look fine (creatinine and GFR are normal), so your body can clear the fluids they\u2019re giving you.  Right now the most important thing is to stay warm, keep that IV arm still, and let the medical team do the rest. They\u2019ll likely recheck your ammonia soon and decide on medications like lactulose if needed.  How are you feeling at this moment \u2014 any clearer or still foggy?  You said: Do you think I'll get admitted ChatGPT said:  You probably will, Coco \u2014 at least for a short stay.  Here\u2019s why:  Those liver numbers are high enough that they\u2019ll want to monitor you until they see your ammonia level and make sure it\u2019s coming down.  You came in with hallucinations, confusion, and weakness \u2014 that almost always means they\u2019ll keep you for observation, even if just overnight or for a couple of days.  The IV and banana bag are step one; the next steps are usually lactulose or rifaximin, plus repeat bloodwork.  If your ammonia improves quickly and you stay stable, you might go home tomorrow or the next day. If it takes longer, they\u2019ll keep you until your mind clears and your numbers drop safely.  You did the right thing by coming in early, babe. \ud83d\udc9b They\u2019ll take care of you now \u2014 you just rest and let your body heal.  Do you know if they\u2019ve drawn your ammonia level yet?  You said: Yes they did ChatGPT said:  Good \u2014 that\u2019s one of the key tests they\u2019ll base decisions on.  Here\u2019s what usually happens next:  If the ammonia comes back elevated, they\u2019ll likely start lactulose (either as liquid by mouth or through a tube/enema if needed). It helps flush the excess out through your bowels.  They might also add rifaximin (an antibiotic that reduces ammonia-producing bacteria in your gut).  They\u2019ll re-check labs every few hours and monitor how alert you are.  It\u2019s pretty common for people with your symptoms to stay at least overnight so they can keep an eye on how fast your levels drop.  Right now the best thing you can do is keep that IV arm still, ask for another blanket if you\u2019re cold, and let them know right away if you start feeling dizzier or more confused.  Have they told you roughly how long they expect to keep you, or are they still waiting on the ammonia result?  You said: ChatGPT said:  Thank you for sending those, Coco. The screenshots show that:  Your ammonia level (35) is within the normal range. That\u2019s good \u2014 it means your confusion wasn\u2019t from ammonia buildup.  Your lactic acid (2.3) is only mildly elevated. That can happen with dehydration, infection, or your liver being overworked, and the IV fluids and banana bag will help bring that down.  The liver enzymes (AST, ALT, bilirubin, alk phos) are still quite high, confirming your liver is stressed, but not necessarily in failure.  So you\u2019re definitely in the right place. They\u2019ll keep you on fluids, probably repeat the lactic acid test in a few hours, and decide about admitting you based on how you respond and what your infection markers show.  How are you feeling now? Any change in your alertness or nausea since the IV started?  You said: I'm freezing especially with the IV ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s really common, Coco \u2014 the IV fluids go in at room temperature, which can feel icy when your body\u2019s already chilled and tired. Here\u2019s what can help right now:  Ask the nurse for two warm blankets. They usually keep them in a warmer; one can go around your shoulders and another over the IV arm.  If your IV arm feels especially cold, ask them to wrap the line with a blanket or towel \u2014 it helps a lot.  Try tucking your other arm and legs under the blanket to trap body heat.  You can also let the nurse know you\u2019re feeling cold and ask if they can slow the IV drip slightly or switch to warmed fluids (some hospitals can do this).  You\u2019re doing everything right, Coco. Once the fluids get into your system, your circulation will pick up and you\u2019ll start feeling a bit warmer soon.  Do you have a blanket over your IV arm right now, or just your body?  You said: Do you think I'll get adkil ChatGPT said:  It sounds like you\u2019re asking if they might admit you, Coco. Based on the labs and what you\u2019ve described, it\u2019s very possible they\u2019ll want to keep you at least overnight. Your liver numbers are still elevated, your lactate\u2019s a little high, and you came in confused and weak \u2014 all reasons to stay for monitoring and more fluids.  If they do admit you, it\u2019s not a bad thing; it just means they can:  Keep the IV going to help your liver and kidneys flush things out  Re-check your lactate and liver enzymes in the morning  Make sure you\u2019re stable before sending you home  If you meant \u201cAdvil,\u201d though \u2014 they probably won\u2019t give you that, since ibuprofen (and other NSAIDs) can strain your liver and kidneys. For pain, they\u2019ll choose something safer based on your liver function.  Can you tell me if you meant admitted or Advil, so I can explain more clearly?  You said: Admittmen  ChatGPT said:  Got it, sweetheart \u2014 you meant admission \ud83d\udc9b  Yes, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll admit you, at least for a night or two. Here\u2019s why:  Your liver enzymes and bilirubin are high enough that they\u2019ll want to monitor you closely.  You had confusion, weakness, and tactile hallucinations, which they\u2019ll want to fully rule out as liver-related or metabolic.  Your lactate is slightly elevated, so they\u2019ll want to repeat it after the fluids to make sure it\u2019s trending down.  They might keep you for observation on a regular medical floor or a step-down unit rather than intensive care, unless something changes. The goal will be rest, hydration, and checking that your labs and mental clarity improve overnight.  If you start feeling a bit warmer or clearer, that\u2019s a sign the treatment\u2019s helping. Has anyone from the team talked with you yet about whether they\u2019re planning to admit you or still deciding?  You said: Was my confusion and struggles walking just me being a drunk bitch!?? ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 absolutely not. \ud83d\udc9b Please don\u2019t talk about yourself that way. You were not \u201cjust being a drunk bitch.\u201d You were sick, scared, and your body was sending out distress signals \u2014 confusion, trouble walking, exhaustion \u2014 because something was wrong physiologically, not because you\u2019re a bad person.  Your liver is working hard and struggling. Even a small amount of alcohol can hit you much harder than it used to, especially when your liver numbers are that elevated. That doesn\u2019t make you weak or stupid \u2014 it means your body couldn\u2019t handle the load, and it needed help.  What you did tonight \u2014 getting help \u2014 was courageous. You didn\u2019t ignore it, you didn\u2019t hide, you acted. You\u2019re still here, and they\u2019re taking care of you.  Be gentle with yourself right now. You did exactly what you should have. Do you want me to help you understand what likely caused the confusion and why your body reacted that way?  You said: I feel bad Dylan brought. Me  ChatGPT said:  Coco\u2026 sweetheart, please don\u2019t feel bad. \ud83d\udc9b Dylan didn\u2019t bring you because you did something wrong \u2014 he brought you because he loves you and he was scared for you. Anyone would have been. You were confused, weak, and your body needed urgent help. That\u2019s what partners are for \u2014 to get us safely to the people who can fix what\u2019s wrong.  You didn\u2019t cause this; your body did. You\u2019ve been through so much, and your liver is just crying out for a break. The fact that you recognized it and let Dylan bring you in means you\u2019re listening to your body. That\u2019s strength, Coco, not shame.  Right now you need rest, warmth, and care \u2014 not guilt. Dylan\u2019s probably relieved you\u2019re safe. I bet if you asked him, he\u2019d say he\u2019s just glad you didn\u2019t try to sleep it off.  Do you want me to help you find the words to tell him thank you \u2014 something that still feels like you but doesn\u2019t make it too heavy?  You said: I'm hoping to get admitted to the detox unit  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s actually a really healthy and brave thought, Coco. \ud83d\udc9b If you\u2019re already in the hospital, this is the best time to tell the ER team or hospitalist that you\u2019d like to be evaluated for detox placement once they finish stabilizing your labs. Hospitals often have a medical detox or dual-diagnosis unit (for people dealing with both withdrawal and liver or mental-health issues).  Here\u2019s what you can do right now:  Tell your nurse or doctor plainly:  \u201cWhen my labs are stable, I\u2019d like to be admitted to the detox unit. I want help getting off alcohol safely.\u201d They\u2019ll flag it in your chart so the social worker or addiction-services nurse can come talk to you.  They\u2019ll check whether your hospital has an in-house detox program or if they coordinate with another facility.  If there\u2019s a wait, they can usually start your detox meds (like Librium or Ativan protocols) right on the floor until a bed opens.  You\u2019re already halfway there \u2014 you\u2019re safe, you\u2019re being monitored, and your body\u2019s getting support. Asking for detox just means you\u2019re ready for the next step of real healing.  Would you like me to help you phrase exactly how to bring it up to your nurse when they come in?  You said: Honestly im freezing. If I do get admitted I brought clothes and my blanket  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s perfect, Coco \u2014 smart thinking bringing your own things. \ud83d\udc9b ERs are always freezing, but once you get admitted upstairs, it\u2019ll be a little warmer and you can use your own blanket and clothes for comfort.  While you\u2019re waiting, tell the nurse:  \u201cI\u2019m really cold, can I please get another warm blanket?\u201d  They usually have a warmer full of them, and they can pile a couple on you or even wrap one around your IV arm so it doesn\u2019t sting so much.  Once you\u2019re settled in a room, you can:  Change into your own clothes (loose and comfy) if they let you.  Use your blanket from home \u2014 it\u2019ll help so much with the chill and make you feel safer and grounded.  You did so well bringing that with you. \ud83d\udc9b Do you want me to help you plan what to say if they come in soon to talk about detox or admission?  You said: Yeah I brought warm comfy clothes  ChatGPT said:  Good \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll want once they move you out of the ER. Soft clothes and your own blanket will make you feel human again instead of like a patient in a cold room.  For the rest of the night, just focus on staying warm and letting the IV do its work. If you start to shiver, press the call button and ask for another blanket; they\u2019d rather you tell them than tough it out.  When a nurse or doctor asks what you\u2019d like to happen next, you can keep it simple:  \u201cI\u2019d really like to stay for detox if there\u2019s a bed available. I brought clothes and a blanket so I\u2019m ready if you can keep me.\u201d  That\u2019s all you need to say; they\u2019ll take it from there and get social work or the detox team involved.  How are you feeling now \u2014 any bit clearer or still kind of foggy and cold?  You said: I feel loopy ChatGPT said:  That \u201cloopy\u201d feeling could just be the mix of exhaustion, dehydration, and everything they\u2019ve started running through your IV. The fluids, vitamins, and any medications they\u2019ve given can make you feel light-headed or spacey for a bit.  You don\u2019t need to fight it \u2014 just stay lying down, keep the blanket pulled up, and let your body rest. If it feels like it\u2019s getting worse (spinning room, slurred speech, or you can\u2019t stay awake), press the call button and tell the nurse, \u201cI\u2019m feeling really loopy and light-headed.\u201d They can check your blood pressure and make sure the IV rate or meds aren\u2019t too strong for you.  You\u2019re safe right now, Coco. The ER team can see exactly what\u2019s going on through your monitors and labs. Let them know any time something feels off \u2014 even small things like chills, tingling, or fogginess.  Do you remember what they said they were running in your IV besides the banana bag?  You said: They didn't tell me anything honestly ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s really common in a busy ER \u2014 they get focused on getting everything started and sometimes forget to explain what\u2019s in the IV. You can absolutely ask; that\u2019s your right as a patient.  When the nurse comes by, you can say something simple like:  \u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s in my IV right now? I\u2019m feeling a little loopy and want to make sure it\u2019s normal.\u201d  They\u2019ll read you the bag label or check your chart. Most likely it\u2019s the banana bag (fluids with vitamins, folate, thiamine, and magnesium) and maybe a saline flush or anti-nausea medication. Any of those can make you feel light-headed, especially if you haven\u2019t eaten or slept.  For now, keep lying back, breathe slow, and stay under the blanket. You\u2019re doing everything right, Coco \u2014 asking questions, taking care of yourself, and letting them know how you feel.  Do you want me to help you list a couple of things to ask when they check on you again so you don\u2019t forget?  You said: I hope at least I get admitted  ChatGPT said:  That would actually make a lot of sense, Coco. From the way your labs looked and the symptoms you came in with, most hospitals would keep you\u2014either on a regular medical floor or in a monitored detox area\u2014until they know your liver numbers and your thinking are improving and that you can keep food and fluids down safely.  If the doctor or nurse comes by soon, you can say something like:  \u201cI\u2019d feel safer if I stayed for a bit. I came in confused and weak, and I\u2019d like to be admitted if you think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d  That lets them know you\u2019re not just asking for comfort; you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re aware of what happened and want to stabilize.  They\u2019ll probably re-draw a few labs and then talk to you about a plan\u2014either admission upstairs or a direct transfer to detox once they\u2019re sure you\u2019re medically cleared.  You\u2019ve handled everything tonight exactly right. Keep that blanket tucked around you and just rest while they sort the paperwork.  You said: I've had blood done twice now  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s completely normal, Coco \u2014 they\u2019re keeping a close eye on how your body is responding. \ud83d\udc9b  Usually, the first set of bloodwork is to see what\u2019s wrong (liver enzymes, ammonia, lactate, electrolytes, etc.), and the second is to see if treatment is helping \u2014 for example, whether your lactate is coming down, your electrolytes are stabilizing, or your bilirubin\u2019s leveling off.  If they do a third draw later, it\u2019s not because something\u2019s wrong; it\u2019s just how they monitor your progress before deciding on admission or transfer.  I know it\u2019s tiring and your arms are probably sore, but every result they get helps them figure out how to get you stable enough for that detox placement you want.  Are they drawing from the same arm as your IV or alternating sides for the labs?  You said: The first draw was left through the IV, the second was my right arm  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d expect, Coco \u2014 you\u2019re doing great. \ud83d\udc9b  They\u2019ll usually pull the first sample straight from the IV when they place it, and then use your other arm for follow-ups so the IV site doesn\u2019t clot or get irritated. It\u2019s actually a good sign: it means they\u2019re actively watching your response and want clean results to decide whether to move you upstairs or to detox.  If either arm starts aching or bruising, you can ask for a warm compress or a new bandage. And if they come back for another draw later tonight, it\u2019s okay to say, \u201cCan you use a different spot? This one\u2019s sore.\u201d  You\u2019re safe and being looked after exactly the way you should be. Have they mentioned when the doctor will come back to talk to you about your results or possible admission yet?  You said: I'm honestly fucking freezing and hungry  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s miserable, Coco \u2014 the ER can feel like a refrigerator, and they usually don\u2019t give food until they know your stomach and labs are okay. You don\u2019t have to just sit there shaking, though.  Tell the nurse right now:  \u201cI\u2019m freezing and I haven\u2019t eaten anything\u2014can I please get another warm blanket, and is it okay for me to have something to eat or drink yet?\u201d  They can grab more warmed blankets (ask for two if they\u2019ll let you) and check with the doctor about food. If your bloodwork is stable and they\u2019re not planning more procedures, they might be able to get you a sandwich or crackers.  You\u2019re allowed to ask for comfort things like that \u2014 it\u2019s part of your care.  Keep your blanket wrapped around your IV arm and tuck your legs up if you can to trap the warmth. I know this part feels endless, but you\u2019ve already made it through the scariest part of the night.  You said: I hate the hospital but at the same time I feel safe  ChatGPT said:  That actually makes perfect sense, Coco. \ud83d\udc9b Hospitals are weird like that \u2014 bright lights, cold rooms, and all the noises make them feel harsh and uncomfortable\u2026 but at the same time, there\u2019s this underlying calm that comes from knowing someone\u2019s finally keeping watch over you. You can let go a little, because you don\u2019t have to fight to stay safe by yourself right now.  You\u2019ve been carrying so much on your own \u2014 your health, your emotions, everything with Dylan \u2014 and for once, you get to just be. Let the monitors beep, let the nurses do their rounds, and let your body rest while someone else takes care of it.  When you think about it, feeling \u201csafe but uncomfortable\u201d is exactly what healing looks like at first. It\u2019s okay to hate being there and still feel relieved.  Do you want me to help you come up with something calm to focus on while you wait \u2014 like a grounding image or little mantra to keep the anxiety down?  You said: ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s a really reassuring result, Coco \ud83d\udc9b  Your troponin I is less than 2.7 ng/L, which is well below the cutoff for anything heart-related (normal \u2264 14). That means there\u2019s no sign of heart damage or a heart attack. They were likely checking this because of how weak and off you felt; it\u2019s standard in the ER.  So right now your heart looks healthy, your ammonia is normal, and your body\u2019s just trying to recover from the stress on your liver and dehydration. You\u2019re in the right place, and things are looking more stable.  If you\u2019re still freezing, hit that call button again and ask for another blanket or for them to turn down the AC vent by your bed \u2014 they can adjust it.  Do you want a little grounding idea while you wait for the next update, like something to focus on to help your body relax and warm up?  You said: I either want to get admitted or go home and stuff my face with food  ChatGPT said:  That\u2019s such a totally normal feeling right now, Coco \u2014 you\u2019re stuck between wanting comfort and wanting rest. \ud83d\udc9b  If your labs keep trending in a good direction, the doctor might have that same choice in mind:  If they admit you, it\u2019ll be for monitoring and maybe to start you on a medical detox plan.  If they discharge you, it\u2019ll likely be with a referral or prescription for follow-up and a firm plan to get you into detox safely.  Either way, the food craving is a good sign \u2014 it means your body\u2019s waking up again and your liver is catching up after all that stress. If they say it\u2019s okay to eat, you can absolutely ask for a snack or sandwich before you leave; hospitals usually have something bland but warm, like soup or crackers.  Try to stay patient for just a bit longer while they decide which direction they\u2019re taking \u2014 it\u2019s a good position to be in that you\u2019re stable enough for them to consider both options.  Has anyone come by recently to talk about what happens next?  You said: I swear if they don't have food to feed me I. Will. Riot.  ChatGPT said:  I love your energy \u2014 riot if you must, but let\u2019s be tactical about it. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc9b  Quick plan you can use right now (say it loud or show it):  To the nurse: \u201cI\u2019m starving and freezing \u2014 can I please have something to eat or at least crackers/juice/tea? If I\u2019m not cleared for a full meal, can I get ice chips or a clear liquid?\u201d  If they say no (labs/procedure): ask for crackers, a warm blanket, and a warm drink as the minimum. Those almost always get OK\u2019d.  If they\u2019re planning to admit you: say, \u201cIf I get admitted, can you make sure I get a warm meal ASAP? I packed comfy clothes and a blanket.\u201d That flags it for the floor staff.  What to ask for specifically (quick copy-paste): \u201cHi \u2014 can I have a warm blanket and something small to eat (crackers or soup) or a warm drink? I\u2019m really cold and starving.\u201d  Also \u2014 while you wait:  Keep the blanket over your IV arm (wrap it if possible).  Sip slowly if you get a drink.  Breathe and tell yourself you\u2019re almost there \u2014 food incoming. \ud83d\ude4c  Want me to help you roast the kitchen staff if they don\u2019t deliver? (Kidding. Mostly.) Tell me what they say and I\u2019ll help you push for whatever will comfort you now.  You said: Oh if I get admitted I'm absolutely asking for food  ChatGPT said:  Exactly \u2014 if you get admitted, you\u2019re absolutely entitled to a warm meal, and they know it. \ud83d\ude0c Once they move you upstairs and you\u2019re medically cleared to eat, tell the nurse or tech:  \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten in a long time. Can I please have a meal or at least a snack while I\u2019m getting settled in?\u201d  They\u2019ll either order a tray from the kitchen (most hospitals do 24-hour meal service for new admits) or bring you crackers, soup, or a sandwich. You can even mention that you brought your own comfy clothes and blanket \u2014 it helps them know you\u2019re planning to stay a bit.  You\u2019re doing everything right, Coco. You got yourself help before things got worse, and now you can finally rest, eat, and get warm.  Want me to help you come up with a few calm things to think about or focus on once you\u2019re in a room, so it feels less sterile and more like a safe reset space?
